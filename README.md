# FraudGuard-Credit-Security-Analytics
This project focuses on building an advanced machine learning system for detecting credit card fraud ðŸ’³. It begins with comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling time-based features, log-transforming transaction amounts, and calculating statistical metrics from anonymized features (V1â€“V28). Categorical variables such as the part of the day are encoded, and features are scaled using Standardization and Normalization to improve model performance. Multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), LinearSVC, and Random Forest, are trained on the processed dataset, with special attention to imbalanced data handling through techniques like class weighting. Each model is rigorously evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, ROC-AUC scores, and regression-style metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) for robust performance assessment. Visualization techniques like heatmaps for confusion matrices and feature importance plots are employed to interpret model results effectively. Overall, this project demonstrates a structured approach to fraud detection, combining feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization to create a reliable system for identifying fraudulent transactions ðŸš¨.
